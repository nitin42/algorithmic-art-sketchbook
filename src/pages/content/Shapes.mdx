# Shapes

## Polar shapes

Polar shapes are crafted by computing the angle and radius of each pixel. To create interesting shapes based on
the angle, I decided to use [Inigo Quilez's Power Curve Function](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/functions/functions.htm).
It changes the radius in such a way that, one side of the shape is skewed. Hence producing leaves and other interesting shapes.

```glsl
float pcurve(float x, float a, float b) {
  float r2 = pow(a, a) * pow(b, b);
  float r1 = pow(a + b, a + b);
  float k = r1 / r2;
  return k * pow(x, a) * pow(1.0 - x, b);
}
```

<div className="center">
  <PolarShapes id="star" />
</div>

<br/>
Let's change the no of sides in the above shader to create another interesting shape.
<br/>
<br/>

<div className="center">
  <PolarShapes id="leaves" useStarShape />
</div>

## Mixed shapes

[Andrew Baldwin's blog](https://thndl.com/square-shaped-shaders.html) wrote an interesting article on constructing the distance
field using the polar coordinates. It involves computing the angle at each pixel point using the built-in function `atan()`.

Extending his example, I thought about computing the radius in a different manner by using the **parabola shaping function**. Use the parabola function, we
can remap 0..1 interval into 0..1 to create mixed shapes.

```glsl
float parabola(float x, float k) {
  return pow(4.0 * x * (1.0 - x), k);
}
```

<div className="center">
  <MixedShapes id="mixed-shape" />
</div>

<br/>

The above shader combines a **circle**, **square**, **heptagon** and **triangle** to create a mixed shape animation.
