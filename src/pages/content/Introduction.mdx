Shader world is an evolving catalogue of shaders based on generative algorithms. Each shader is followed by a short
description and code snippet explaining the algorithm behind the changing visual.

## Table of contents

* [Truchet Tiles](./TruchetTiles)

* [Randomess](./RandomnessCircles)

* [Tiles and Arcs](./TilesArcs)

* [Noise with Gain curve](./NoiseGain)

* [Noise & shapes](./NoiseShape)

* [Mixed Shapes](./Shapes)

## About

### Animations

Artworks in the catalogue are animated using the shader playback time along with the shaping functions. For a visual representation of how the
shaping functions are integrated, checkout out [**these**](https://shaping-functions.surge.sh/) curves.

### Rendering

To make it easy to pass data and other GLSL values through the shaders, all the shaders are rendered using [**this**](https://github.com/nitin42/react-shader-canvas) wrapper function with [**React**](https://reactjs.org/).

## Acknowledgement

This project was made possible only because of [**Patricio Gonzalez**](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) and [**Jen Lowe**](http://jenlowe.net/) for their work on [**The Book of Shaders**](https://thebookofshaders.com/), which is an excellent
resource on learning Fragment Shaders.

A big thanks to [**Íñigo Quílez**](https://www.iquilezles.org/), whose blog and tutorials played a vital role in the creation of artworks and computational models behind it.
