Shader world is an evolving catalogue of shaders based on generative algorithms. Each shader is followed by a short
description and the code snippet to explain the algorithm behind the changing visual.

### Table of contents

* [Truchet Tiles]()

* [Truchet Tiles with shader playback time]()

* [Randomess and Circles]()

* [Tiles and Arcs]()

* [Noise]()

* [Noise with Gain curve]()

* [Noisy shapes]()

### Tools

#### Animations

Artworks in the catalogue are animated using the shader playback time along with the shaping functions. For a visual representation of how the
shaping functions are integrated, checkout out [**these**](https://shaping-functions.surge.sh/) curves.

#### Rendering

To make it easy to pass data and other GLSL values through the shaders, all the shaders are rendered using [**this**](https://github.com/nitin42/react-shader-canvas) wrapper function with [**React**](https://reactjs.org/).

### Acknowledgement

This project was made possible only because of [**Patricio Gonzalez**](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) and [**Jen Lowe**](http://jenlowe.net/) for their work on [**The Book of Shaders**](https://thebookofshaders.com/), which is an excellent
resource on the complex universe of Fragment Shaders.

A big thanks to [**Íñigo Quílez**](https://www.iquilezles.org/) whose blog and research in computer graphics played a vital role in the creation of artwork and computational models behind it.
