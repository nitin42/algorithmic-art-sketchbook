# About

**Algorithmic Art Sketchbook** documents my work in the field of algorithmic drawing and computer graphics.
Inside the sketchbook, you will find the generative designs, description about the art, design tools, short
tutorials on creating algorithmic art and write-up on intersection of form and code.

The main purpose of this sketchbook is to make things easier such as uploading and sharing my work
with the community. This includes crafting new designs, writing my own shaping functions, write-ups and designing new tools.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I do writing it!
